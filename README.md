Bidding App
first login with your userName and Password then you'll be directed to the main screen where all the availabe items are . Select any that you want then it will show  the entire detiles about that specific item and will ask you to bid . Place you amount and it will evalute wheather you're a winner or losser in the game. I use react native to buid the app and unfortunatly I'm not completely done because I started a backen but not done.

HOW TO USED THE APP.
Clone it from github and install type NPM INSTALL for node pakage manager.
NPM INSTALL EXPO-CLI 
EXPO GO IN YOUR PHONE TO RUN THE APP OR ANDRIOD EMULATOR IF YOU HAVE ONE.
